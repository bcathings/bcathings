# BCA NOTES 

Just notes for BCA following the **MGU syllabus.**

Now, what i wrote up is completely on you and i dont care if they are wrong i
am not responsible for anything said in this book. 

open a pull request on github if you want it corrected. 

now, there is still stuff missing and stuff they didnt teach me for some reason,
if anything, Im trying to finish this. maybe, but feel free to open up issues on github.

they didnt give you notes for math? some equations? they probably dont know $\LaTeX$

here ya go, the notes. stop depending on people who dont care about you. even me.
