# SEMESTER THREE : Graphics.
## MODULE 2

## Drawing algorithms

- Line drawing algorithms
    - DDA algorithm
    - Breshnham''s Line Algorithm.
- Circle drawing algorithm.
    - Midpoint circle algorithm
- Character generation

## Output primitives
Graphics programming packages provide functions to describe a scene in terms of these
basic geometric structures Output **primitives.**
To create complex pictures we use sets of output primitives.
Basic building blocks of a picture are called Output primitives.

- Point
- Line
- Circle

## graphics functions. ( kinda idk )
To load a specified color into the frame buffer, the function used is 
`setPixel(x,y)`

To retrive a specified color from the frame buffer, the function used is 
`getPixel(x,y)`

## Line Drawing algorithms.
The slope intercept equation for a straight line is 
\begin{equation}
 y = mx + b 
(\#eq:slopeintercept)
\end{equation}

with $m$ representing the slope of the lien and b as the $y$ intercept.
give that the two endpoints of a line segment are specified, $(x_{1}, y_{1} ) , (x_{2}, y_{2} )$ posiitions 


the values for the slope $m$ and $y$ intercept b can be determined with the following
calculations.

\begin{equation}
m = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} 
(\#eq:slope)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
b = y_{1} - m . x_{1}
(\#eq:yintercept)
\end{equation}

algorithms for displaying straight lines are based on line equations \@ref(eq:slopeintercept) and the calculations 
given in \@ref(eq:slope) and \@ref(eq:yintercept)

for any given $x$ interval
$\Delta x$ along a line the corresponding $y$ interval $\Delta y$ can be calculated from
equation \@ref(eq:slope) as 

\begin{equation}
\Delta y = m \Delta x
(\#eq:deltay)
\end{equation}


Similarly, $x$ interval $\Delta x$ can be obtained as 

\begin{equation}
\Delta x = \frac{\Delta y}{x}
(\#eq:deltax)
\end{equation}


the above equations form the basis determining defelection volatages in analog devices
4 lines with slope magnitudes $| m | < 1, \Delta x$ can be set proportional
to small horizontal defelection voltage and the corresponding vertical defelection voltage is then 
set proportional to $\Delta y$ as calculated from equation no \@ref(eq:deltay) for lines with slope 
magnitude $|m|>1,\Delta y$ can be proportional to a small vertical defelection voltage with corresponding
horizontal defelection voltage set proportional to $\Delta x$ as calculated from equation no \@ref(eq:deltax)
for lines $m=1,\Delta x=\Delta y$ the horizontal and vertical defelection volatages are equal.

In each case a smooth line with slop $m$ is generatated between the specified points.
